      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hi! My name is Dylan Adams and currently enrolled in my final semester
        as a student at RMIT. My student number is s3849200 & you can contact me
        at s3849200@student.rmit.edu.au. I am born and raised in Eastern
        Melbourne Australia where I have undertaken my high school studies at
        St. Josephs College Ferntree Gully. I am also involved in a local
        football team (Upper Ferntree Gully) where I spend most of my Saturday’s
        playing & supporting the club. I also have 2 dogs, one named Spud who is
        14 and a border collie, and another named Letty, who is only 6 months
        and is the newest addition to our family. <br />
        <br />
        My interest in IT first sparked when I got my very first iPod touch in
        grade 4. It was around the time of the iPhone launch that I became
        obsessed with Apple, especially with how advanced their products were
        compared to their competitors. For me, this signalled the beginning of a
        journey, during which I developed an interest in gaming and succeeded in
        building my own PC. I achieved this through endless hours of YouTube,
        which guided my learning and honed my skills, and so, my interest
        continued to evolve. In terms of technology, I work with multiple Apple
        products including MacBook, iPhone, Apple watch & Airpods as they all
        work seamlessly together. I find this increases my productivity
        considerably and eliminates any headache I may encounter otherwise. I
        also use a dedicated windows PC for gaming as it is better optimised.
        <br />
        <br />
        RMIT was a suitable choice for me as they offered the course of
        accounting which was my chosen path on completing year 12. In comparison
        to other Universities, it is easily accessible by catching a train
        straight to Melbourne Central which eliminates the need to drive. In
        hindsight this is cheaper as I am not spending money on petrol or
        parking. RMIT is further fitting to myself as a student in the way my
        classes are run. They are interactive and fun which has enhanced my
        learning experience during the course of my studies. <br />
        <br />

        As I am now in my final semester, I have learned many things business
        related which I believe will aid me as I apply my skills to the real
        world. I have learned how businesses operate from a financial standpoint
        to other miscellaneous subjects such as the ins and outs of
        cryptocurrency to coding in Python. These electives will hopefully
        benefit me in my career and my goal to have a financially stable future.

        The position available at ID Digital Agency is appealing to me as it is
        targeting some of skills that I am learning. These are JavaScript, HTML,
        CSS, React & Next.js which based of research I have found to be the most
        popular skills in software development. The role also has next.js in its
        required set of skills which I do not have. My guess is that next.js is
        similar to react & node being an extended framework for JavaScript. The
        experience required is 4+ years which I do not currently have however it
        is a role I would consider when the time comes. My current skills that I
        can apply are HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and fundamentals for React. <br />
        <br />
        In order for me to obtain all skills on the list I will continue to
        learn whether that is through my course this semester or YouTube. I will
        also apply my skills by creating projects so that I can show the
        employer that I am passionate in what I do and am willing to work hard
        to gain experience outside of school. Furthermore, I take pride in all
        my work and always give it my top effort, to produce the best outcomes.

      The results below indicate to me that I am a very laid-back character
      although when work needs to be done, I will not stop until it is complete.
      I discovered I am both introvert and extravert in the sense that I like
      attention however will not go out of my way for it. This means that I know
      when and when not to speak up which is a positive trait to take into a
      team. I understand what is going on around me very well which is good for
      identifying key problems within a team. This means that I should observe
      carefully who I chose for a team however I personally believe I should be
      open to work with everyone and treat it as an experience as there will be
      times in my life where I will not have a choice.

      <p class="project-p">
        The idea that I have thought of is a contact tracing Sherrin football.
        There will be a sensor that will log where on the ball it has made
        contact with the foot or hand. This will allow for people to gain an
        understanding of how the ball is being kicked and handballed. This could
        be beneficial for AFL players as it will show the average point made
        contact which could help each team improve their skill sets allowing
        them to be more competitive. It can also be used as a training method
        for new players who want to improve at the sport.
        <br />
        <br />
        Motivation for this product was inspired by the Mark Williams Sherrin
        Football. This yellow football has a visible red spin line included to
        help kick the footy correctly which enhances the player to kick better.
        It is used by AFL clubs Richmond & Western bull dogs already which
        indicates its success. As someone who plays footy, I feel like this
        product would benefit my skills as a player. A Footy with a chip inside
        of it would give you even further feedback with a technology element
        enabling it to log even more precise.

        <br />
        <br />
        The Sherrin pressure football is new in its class with spiderweb
        sensors. There are two main sensors on each side of the footy which is
        passed by static wire which picks up the contact on the outside of the
        football. This wire acts as a spiderweb running through the entirety of
        the inside leather. It will act as pressure sensor which will transmit a
        signal with the chip which is also located in the footy. From here the
        signal will be passed through to the Bluetooth module which can transmit
        the signal to the app. The Bluetooth technology will be using Bluetooth
        5.0 which will allow the data to transfer up to speeds of 2 Mbps which
        is twice the speed of 4.2. Whilst also having faster download speeds 5.0
        also supports extended range which at 243 meters up from 10 meters which
        is beneficial as it allows players to comfortably roam the ground
        without having to worry about connection issues. In order for this to
        work properly the materials used would have to obtain being leather.
        Leather is the only material that will work efficiently as it is strong
        flexible and durable enough to be a housing for these components, unlike
        a synthetic one due to its elasticity. The stitching of the football
        contains another layer running across the top to support the hardware on
        the inside. The football is available in red and yellow simulating the
        match balls to which will be red stitching on the yellow footballs and
        yellow stitching on the red footballs to differentiate a pressure
        football from a standard one. Available in size 5, 4, 3 and 2. The app
        is called “AFL Training” which is compatible on iPhone & android on the
        respected app stores. It can be downloaded for free and available to any
        user 4+. Each football comes with a linking code which is then inputted
        into the app. From here each time the user starts a session they can
        look at average contact points made represented by dots on a virtual
        football for that session. It will use machine learning to try and
        correct the individuals kick which will improve as the individual uses
        the app.

        <br />
        <br />
        For this to work efficiently an app would be created which would require
        coding. This would enhance the experience of the user as it would
        display logs in a fancy way keeping them engaged with their training.
        The hardware required would be a match day football, sensors, a chip,
        which would include processing and Bluetooth. In order to make this work
        I would need to find someone with experience in app development to
        create the app. I would also need to work with a designer/engineer to
        come up with different concepts of how the hardware can be compatible
        with each other. Finally, a manufacturer which would be sourced in
        Melbourne by getting in contact with the Sherrin factory.

        <br />
        <br />
        The outcome of this project will enhance skills for professionals and
        propel training for new players. There is no problem with the original
        although the help of a technology integrated football would be
        beneficial to the game. The outcome would also cause the players to
        improve professionally which may bring in more money and sponsorships
        for the game. It could also breach the gap for normal AFL & AFLW in
        terms of player salaries which has been a problem for the sport.
